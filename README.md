# Hospital-Networking-Using-Cisco
This project describes the network design of Health care management or Hospital. 

We have used Cisco Packet Tracer for designing the network topology
In this network topology the nodes (i.e., computers, switches, routers or other devices) are connected to a local area network (LAN) and network via links
